    <h2>Al-Qaeda</h2>
    <p>Al-Qaeda was founded in 1988. They were originally part of the mujahedeen, as stated earlier. Their rise to infamy began with the 1988 US Embassy bombings. They were origianlly led and on a major part funded by Osama Bin Laden. Under his command, the al-Qaeda conducted the most infamous and destructive terrorist attack of all time: 9/11, or the plane hijackings that led to the destruction of the WTC. After this, they became the US public enemy #1, and a manhunt for Osama was conducted. It took 10 years to hunt him and track him down, where he was finally killed in a Navy SEAL team in 2011. After his death, al-Qaeda faded from existence, and gave way to other, more ruthless organisations... </p><br><img src="/images/image13.png">

    <h2>ISIS</h2>
    <p style="style2">As said earlier, after al-Qaeda lost most of its power, a new generation of terrorist organizations appeared. The most brutal of them, ISIS, quickly gained fame (the bad kind).</p> <p> They started gaining prominence in 2014, when they pronounced themselves a caliphate. They are willing to kill all people who don't worship Sunni Islam, and have commited numerous attrocities. They have released numerous videos of their victims being tortured to death on the internet and have conducted many massacres of prisoners. </p>
    <p>ISIS has claimed responsiblity for many recent terrorist attacks. In additon, ISIS is a lot more organised than al-Qaeda, especially after the death of Bin Laden. They have occupied a territory and were governing it based off of their beliefs, before being defeated in multiple battles with the Iraqi army and the international coalition. They still are a threat today, and are capable of mounting deadly attacks worldwide. </p><br><img src="/images/image1.png">

    <h2>Other organizations</h2>
    <p>Two other notable terrorist organizations are Boko Haram and Hamas. Boko Haram is a terrorist group based in Nigeria, where their capture of over 50 schoolgirls made world headlines. It is connected to ISIS and is also a Islamic terrorist group. Hamas is also a jihadist group, but it is based near Israel. They have made many human rights abuses and have an ongoing war with their surronding countries. </p><br>
