    <h2>Political Beliefs</h2>
    <p>On the other hand, the terrorist organization al-Qaeda was originally part of a Muslim resistance force called the mujahideen which fought the Soviet Union, which occupied much of their homelands. After the Soviets were driven out, some of the mujahideen wanted to continue to fight for Muslims being oppressed in the world. However, they soon began to conduct terrorist attacks against non-Muslims and were labeled a terrorist organization.</p> <img src="/images/image11.jpg">
