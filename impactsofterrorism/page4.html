    <h2>What we did in the past decade</h2>
    <p>For the last decade or so, there has been a "war on terror". Such events include the US and other countries' troops in the Middle East, and also their cooperative training of Middle Eastern countries armed forces to deal with terrorists. An example war in the overall war against terror is the Afghanistan War. However, many terrorist organizations are the creations of wars, such as al-Qaeda being a branch of the Afghan resistance forces before they became terrorists. </p><br>

    <h2>What we are curently doing</h2>
    <p>Currently, the US government still has some troops in the Middle East, but is now mostly helping to train the Middle Eastern countries' armed forces to fight terrorists. The US also does support missions against terrorists, such as drone strikes. However, more terrorists are appearing in Africa and other parts of the world, so the international coalition is directing more of their attention towards those areas. </p> <br>

    <h2>Future possible solutions</h2>
    <p>What the US is currently doing against terrorists is much more effective then simply sending in the military. By training and helping local governments, terrorism is stopped at its roots. However, another thing the US government can be doing is neutralising the terrorists funds and recruiting, so they can't cause as much damage. </p>
