<h1 id="H1">HTML</h1>
  <p>The html tag is used to tell the computer that the following document is going to be written in HTML. Its syntax usually at the very beginning and end of the and is usually represented by a &lt;html&gt; tag. This element is used in all html documents and is always at the beginning and end of all the other code,but it never appears on your web page when you use it. 
  <br>
  </p>
  <h3>An example</h3>
  <p>&lt;html&gt;<br>*insert random code<br>&lt;/html&gt;</p>
<br>
<h1 id="H2">Headers</h1>
  <p>The header tag is used to tell the computer to not include the following information as actual rendering but instead tells the computer use the data included inside to describe text that will appear on the website. Its syntax is &lt;head&gt;, and it appears usually right after the first html tag and after all the data decribing the document's style. It is also used in all html docs with a style description not included in the paragraph or heading tags. 
  </p> <br>
  <h3>An example</h3>
  <p>&lt;html&gt;<br>&lt;head&gt;<br>*Random Stuff<br>&lt;/head&gt;<br>...</p>
<br>
<h1 id="H3">Titles</h1>
  <p>The title tag is used to specify the title of a document. Its syntax is &lt;title&gt;,and the title doesn't show up on the document as well. It is just the title of the tab. I can't really make an example, but it appears inside of the header tags. 
    </p>
<br>
<h1 id="H4">Body</h1>
  <p>The body tag is used to show which text written should appear on the website. All the text inside will appear, if written correctly. Its syntax is &lt;body&gt;
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>An Example</h3>
  <p>&lt;html&gt;<br>...<br>&lt;body&gt;<br>&lt;/body&gt;<br>...</p>
<br>
<h1 id="H5">Headings</h1>
  <p>Headings are the tags for the large bold text that I use to start out my paragraphs with a title. It creates the title of "headings" for this paragraph. Its syntax is &lt;h1&gt;, but can be any number from 1-6 </p>
  <br>
  <h3>This is an example(literally)</h3>
  <p>&lt;html&gt;<br>&lt;h1&gt;Text&lt;/h1&gt;<br>&lt;/html&gt;</p>
<br>
<h1 id="H6">Paragraphs</h1>
<p>Paragraphs are the backbone of creating a website. Most of the text you write will be in this format. Paragraphs' syntaxes are represented by the &lt;p&gt; tag. They are basically the small text that I am using to write all this text with.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>An example</h3><br>
  <p>&lt;p&gt;This is literally my example&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<br>
<h1 id="H7">Breaks</h1>
  <p>Breaks are the same as a 'return/enter' when you are typing. It just skips your text to the next line. Their syntax is &lt;br&gt;. I use breaks to separate my paragraphs to organise them so they aren't combined in one giant paragraph. There are mainly used for aesthetics as well, and I use this almost 40 times in just this reference sheet.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3>An example</h3>
  <p>text<br>&lt;br&gt;<br>text</p>
<br>
<h1 id="H8">Lines</h1>
<p>The lines elements are used to make a horizonatal divider line between text in HTML. Their syntax is represented by&lt;hr&gt; Line usage in websites include a purpose as divides between sections or the title, mostly for aesthetic purposes.
</p>
<br>
<h3>An example</h3>
<p>stuff<br>&lt;hr&gt;<br>more stuff</p>
<hr>
<br>
<h1 id="H9">Comments</h1>
  <p>Comments are used to write random stuff in your code for reference without them actually appearing in your actual site. They are represented by the &lt;!-- --&gt; tag. You insert whatever you comment in between the dual &lt;--'s . Comments are useful for people while they are making their website to remind themselves to do stuff later.
  </p>
<br>
<h3>An example</h3>
<br>
<p>text <br>&lt;!--fsdffds--&gt;. <br> Note that the comment text should not actually appear</p>
<br>
<h1 id="H10">Links</h1>
  <p>Links are a very important part of a web page, as you can link them to another web site by a single click. Links follow the &lt;a href="..."&gt;...&gt; structure. The first ... is the actual url of the link and the second... is the text it appears as. I use this kind of code to link my ref sheet to my main page.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>An example as well as appearance</h3>
    <br><p>&lt;a href="www.google.com"&gt;Google Website&gt;</p>
    <br><a href="www.google.com">Google Website</a>
<br>
<h1 id="H11">Images</h1>
<p>Images are also an important aspect of web pages. Most good looking web pages have at least a few images for reference. They are represented by the &lt;img&gt; tag. My other site about my project on terrorism has images.</p>
<br>
<h3>An example and code</h3>
<br>
<p>&lt;img src="meme.jpg"&gt;</p>
<img src="pepe.jpg" alt="meme">
<br>
<h1 id="H12">Lists</h1>
<p>Lists are used to organise things by number or bullet point in HTML. They can be both represented by &lt;ul&gt; or &lt;ol&gt;. Ul is unorganised, and Ol is organised. You can change the styles of the lists by saying style=... All items in the list must have a tag saying &lt;li&gt;. Online lists use this kind of code.</p>
<br>
<h3>Examples of both</h3>
<br>
<ol>
<li>derp</li>
<li>murp</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>hi</li>
  <li>bye</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h1 id="H13">Tables</h1>
<p>In HTML, tables are also used to organise things. Tables are represented by the &lt;table&gt; tag. Each block of the table must have the &lt;tr&gt; tag while every individual item in each section has its sections has a "td" tag, while the headers have a "th" tag. . My reference page uses a table of such.
</p>
<br>
<h3>An example</h3>
<p>&lt;table&gt;<br>&lt;tr&gt;<br>&lt;tq&gt;item&lt;/tq&gt;<br>&lt;/tr&gt;<br>&lt;/table&gt; </p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>hi</th>
    <th>bye</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>derp</td>
    <td>deerp</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>
<h1 id="H14">Blocks</h1>
<p>In HTML, blocks are used to divide the webpages sections into different styles. They are represented by both the &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; tags. Div is more for creating actual blocks but span is for inline style giving. You put the wanted style in the tags by adding style="..." Then you put the stuff you want to style in between the beginning and end of the tags. This would be useful for giving a website multiple different sections with different styles. 
</p> <br>
<h3>An example</h3>
<br>
<div>Hello</div>
<div>World</div>

<p>The DIV element is a block element, and will start on a new line.</p>
